# Node.js Test Automation Samples

This repo contains samples that demonstrate how to use do test automations using Node.js. 
The samples uses Cucumber.js to do various kinds of tests, including API test, Web UI test, mobile test etc.

These samples use Cucumber.js 3.x. While most of the sample works well with Cucumber.js only, it is recommended to open and run them with [CukeTest](http://cuketest.com) application, 
which can boost the productivity of your work. It also has built-in Cucumber.js, which means you only need to install the packages 
that do the actual automation.

## Using the samples

1. first install the npm packages, by going to the command prompt of the "shopping" folder and running the following from command line:
```
npm install
```
2. open "shopping" folder in CukeTest and click run.

> **Note:** The folder end with "-zh" are samples with Chinese feature files.
